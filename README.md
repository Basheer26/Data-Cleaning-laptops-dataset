# Data Cleaning with Pandas - laptops dataset

## Dataset
In this guided project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka.
The original dataset isn't available on Kaggle anymore, but you can find it

### The data cleaning workflow is the following:<br/>
Explore the data in the column -> Identify patterns and special cases -> Remove non-digit characters -> Convert the column to a numeric dtype -> Rename columns if required
