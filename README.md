# Data Cleaning with Pandas and Numpy - laptops dataset

## Dataset
In this guided project, I work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.
The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka and could be found in the file section. The dataset is a sample of 50,000 of the original dataset.

### The data cleaning workflow is the following:<br/>
Explore the data in the column -> Identify patterns and special cases -> Remove non-digit characters -> Convert the column to a numeric dtype -> Rename columns if required
